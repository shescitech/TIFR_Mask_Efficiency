# Data Recorder (data_record.py)
You can use this file to get access to real time data from the particle counter via telnet server. For this you need to enable the telnet protocol in your computer if it is not enabled already. Add filters, analysis, and plot features as required. Data is finally exported to file "data.csv" by default.
