# Visualize the particle count and measure efficiency of the mask

This folder consists of code to visualize the particles count and calculate mask efficiency from the measured data.


## Procedure to use the it

1. Download the code
2. Open the index.html in your web browser
3. Click start to start acquiring data
4. Select particle size of your interest
5. The data will be acquired over time and will be displayed on graph
6. You can change the graph properties by clicking on the setting (wrench) button on top
7. You can download current graph data by clicking on the "download current data" button
8. You can download all data using "Download all data button"


## Procedure to calculate efficiency

a. Start your mask testing setup and follow the above steps from 1-5
b. Acquire the data with and without mask
c. Click on the "Efficiency" in the calculator section
d. Move the vertical cursor to the appropriate position for the with and without mask region.
