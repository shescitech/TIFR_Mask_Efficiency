# Open source design for mask efficiency testing

The project consists of all the code, design documents, and instructions to make a low-cost, face mask particulate filtration efficiency tester developed at TIFR. For starters, please read the PDF file [TIFR_Mask_Tester_07Aug20.pdf](TIFR_Mask_Tester_07Aug20.pdf), this contains an overview of the project.

## Publication

We have used a similar setup to study how [Recharging improves efficiency of decontaminated N95 masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13641)


## About us

We are a small group in the Department of Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in India working on the design of low cost mask testing equipment and efficient mask design.
