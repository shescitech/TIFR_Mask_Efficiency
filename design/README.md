# TIFR Mask Efficiency measurement and Enhancement Setup

Here we present an easy to make Mask efficiency testing device using a Plantower 7003 sensor.
This sensor has been traditionally used for measuring Air Quality Index.

Different kinds of masks are available for protection against coronavirus, as shown in the image below:

Some people use a simple handkerchief or cloth to cover the face as well.

All of these have varying efficiencies of protection against the viruses. 

The project consists of all code design and documentation to design face mask efficiency tester
